#Investigating and Identifying Poisoning Attacks on Machine Learning
Project files for COMP3000

In this project the integrity of machine learning against poisoning attacks will be investigated through the use of a python program using scikit-learn to create a machine learning environment to simulate an attack. Matplotlib will be used to provide a graphical representation of how the attack has affected the results of a multi-round machine learning process. To then prevent this scenario a model for detecting the possible presence of a poisoned data set having been entered into a machine learning system will be created that assesses the results of multiple data sets being used to train the features of a specified data set to identify if a poisoned set is present. The model will then flag any data sets it believes to be poisoned so that the integrity of any machine learning system can be preserved.

User Guide

The project is a python script run using Jupyter notebook. Inside the report it documents the software used to run this project, downloading Anaconda navigator is recommended for ease of use in launching Jupyter notebook as it comes pre-installed. The project notebook file should be saved in a folder with all the CSV data sets that are used as part of the project.
When opening Jupyter notebook it will open in a browser and prompt the user to navigate through their file system to find and open the project notebook file. The notebook will open in a new tab on the browser, the code should be run cell by cell from top to bottom otherwise certain functions will not work.
